# Machine Setup for Hyperledger-Fabric

### - Linux
There are some prerequisites that must be satisfied in order to be able to develop Blockchain applications on Hyperledger Fabric.

So, there are two scripts to do this setup.

You should run the first one:
```
./fabric-setup-part1.sh
```
Then you should exit your machine and enter again (Docker bureaucracies).

Now you should run the second one:
```
./fabric-setup-part2.sh
```
